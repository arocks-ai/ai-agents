# AI Agent for Medical Insurance Pre-Authorization

This project aims to build an AI agent that automates the pre-authorization process for medical procedures. The agent will use Google AI technologies like Vertex AI and Gemini to handle requests from healthcare providers, interact with insurance systems, and provide timely approvals or denials.

## Key Features

- **Automated Pre-Authorization:** The agent will automate the process of submitting, tracking, and receiving pre-authorization for medical procedures.
- **Cost Estimation:** The agent will provide patients and providers with estimated costs and out-of-pocket expenses.
- **Real-time Notifications:** The agent will send real-time notifications to doctor's offices regarding the status of pre-authorization requests.

## Technology Stack

- **Python:** The core programming language for the agent.
- **Google Vertex AI:** Used for building, deploying, and managing the AI agent.
- **Google Gemini:** The underlying large language model for the agent.
